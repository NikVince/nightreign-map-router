## Database
This project uses **Supabase** as the managed PostgreSQL database solution. All backend data is stored and accessed via Supabase, which provides a scalable and developer-friendly Postgres environment. You can use the [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/) to manage your database, authentication, and storage.

If you are migrating from another database (e.g., Planetscale, MySQL), please update your `.env` file with the Supabase PostgreSQL connection string. See the [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) for more details.

> **Note:** A `.env.example` file will be added soon to help contributors set up their environment. Please do not commit real secrets or credentials.
