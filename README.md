# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Database

This project uses **Supabase** as the managed PostgreSQL database solution. All backend data is stored and accessed via Supabase, which provides a scalable and developer-friendly Postgres environment. You can use the [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/) to manage your database, authentication, and storage.

If you are migrating from another database (e.g., Planetscale, MySQL), please update your `.env` file with the Supabase PostgreSQL connection string. See the [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) for more details.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
