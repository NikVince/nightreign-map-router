# Route Optimization Algorithm Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the route optimization algorithm for Elden Ring: Nightreign. The algorithm calculates optimal paths between POIs based on priority scores, team composition, and various game state counters.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Day 1 and Day 2 Route Logic

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ **Day 1 Route**: Spawn Location → Night 1 Circle Location (Red Line)
- ✅ **Day 2 Route**: Night 1 Circle Location → Night 2 Circle Location (Bright Blue Line)
- ✅ **15-Minute Time Constraint**: Each day has 900 seconds of exploration time
- ✅ **No Duplicate POI Visits**: POIs visited on Day 1 are excluded from Day 2
- ✅ **Visual Distinction**: Red line for Day 1, bright blue line for Day 2
- ✅ **Debug Panel**: Separate sections for each day's route with improved readability

### Route Calculation Flow
1. **Extract Start/End Points**: From layout data (Spawn Point, Night 1 Circle, Night 2 Circle)
2. **Calculate Day 1 Route**: Spawn → Intermediate POIs → Night 1 Circle
3. **Calculate Day 2 Route**: Night 1 Circle → Intermediate POIs → Night 2 Circle
4. **Track Visited POIs**: Prevent duplicates between days
5. **Visualize Routes**: Red line for Day 1, bright blue line for Day 2

## CRITICAL: Single Source of Truth for POI Data

### Authoritative Data Sources
**NEVER create mock data or placeholder values. Use ONLY these sources:**

1. **`public/assets/maps/poi_coordinates_with_ids.json`**
   - Contains all 213 POIs with exact coordinates (IDs 1-213)
   - **ONLY** authoritative source for POI coordinates
   - Used by: All route calculation and visualization components

2. **`public/assets/maps/coordinates_backup/poi_name_coordinate_map.js`**
   - Contains POI names mapped to coordinates
   - **ONLY** authoritative source for POI naming
   - Used by: POI identification and display components

3. **`reference_material/pattern_layouts/layout_XXX.json`**
   - Contains POIs present in each specific seed (1-320)
   - **ONLY** authoritative source for which POIs are available in current layout
   - Used by: Route calculation to determine available POIs

### Static (Fixed) vs Dynamic (Layout-Based) POIs

#### Static/Fixed POIs
- **Definition:** POIs that are always present for a given map tile layout, regardless of the current pattern/layout_XXX.json (e.g., Sites of Grace, Spirit Streams, Spectral Hawk Trees, Scarabs, Buried Treasures, etc.).
- **Source:** Defined in the master coordinate files (e.g., `poi_coordinates_with_ids.json` and map-specific coordinate files in `/public/assets/maps/coordinates/`).
- **Shifting Earth Events:** The set of static POIs can change depending on the active Shifting Earth event, as each event can have its own map tile layout and thus its own set of fixed POIs. The correct coordinate file is loaded based on the event (e.g., `the_crater_map_layout.json` for Crater event).
- **Rendering:** Always rendered if their category is enabled, regardless of the current dynamic layout.

#### Dynamic POIs
- **Definition:** POIs determined by the currently loaded `layout_XXX.json` file (i.e., the current seed/pattern). Represent variable content for each run.
- **Source:** Extracted from the current layout file, then mapped to coordinates and IDs using the master coordinate list.
- **Rendering:** Only POIs present in the current layout are rendered as dynamic POIs.

#### Combination and Filtering
- The system **combines** dynamic POIs (from the current layout) with static POIs (from the coordinate files) to produce the full set of visible icons.
- **Duplicates** are removed based on coordinate proximity.
- **Category filtering** allows users to toggle which types of POIs are visible.

#### Shifting Earth Event Handling
- The active Shifting Earth event determines which map tile layout and static POI set is used.
- Both static and dynamic POIs must be mapped to the correct layout.

#### Implementation Principle: Avoid Code Duplication
- **Do not duplicate code unless there is a clear, documented benefit.**
- If duplication is necessary for performance or maintainability, document the reason and the benefit in this file.

### Layout-Based Route Calculation
**Routes must be calculated SOLELY from POIs present in the currently loaded layout and the static POIs for the current map tile layout:**

- **Input**: Current `layout_XXX.json` file based on selected seed, plus static POIs for the current map tile layout (including Shifting Earth event if active)
- **Process**: Extract POIs from layout → Combine with static POIs → Map to coordinates from `poi_coordinates_with_ids.json`
- **Output**: Route only through POIs that appear in the layout and have visible icons
- **Constraint**: Never consider POIs not present in the current layout or static set for the current map tile layout

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Layout Selection & Shifting Earth → Extract Dynamic POIs & Load Static POIs → Combine & Map to Coordinates → Calculate Route → Visualize
     ↓                                 ↓                        ↓                    ↓              ↓
layout_XXX.json & map_layout.json → POI List (dynamic + static) → poi_coordinates_with_ids.json → Route Algorithm → Map Display
```

## Core Algorithm Architecture

### State Management Counters
The algorithm maintains several critical counters that influence route decisions:

#### 1. **Runes Gained Counter**
- **Purpose**: Tracks total runes collected during the expedition
- **Increment**: Add estimated rune rewards from each visited POI
- **Source**: POI_INFO_FOR_ALGORITHM.md rune values
- **Usage**: Determines player level and influences POI priority

#### 2. **Player Level**
- **Purpose**: Tracks current player level for difficulty calculations
- **Increment**: Automatic based on runes gained counter
- **Thresholds**: Based on actual Elden Ring level requirements
- **Usage**: Determines which POIs are viable targets

#### 3. **Stonesword Keys Counter**
- **Purpose**: Tracks available keys for Evergaol access
- **Increment**: +1 when visiting Forts or Great Churches
- **Decrement**: -1 when visiting Evergaols
- **Usage**: Determines Evergaol accessibility

#### 4. **Countdown Timer**
- **Purpose**: Tracks remaining time in the day cycle
- **Start Value**: 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- **Decrement**: Subtract estimated completion time for each visited POI
- **Usage**: Determines route viability and circle constraints

#### 5. **Visited POIs Counter** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Purpose**: Tracks POIs visited to prevent duplicates between days
- **Increment**: Add POI ID when visited
- **Usage**: Excludes visited POIs from subsequent day calculations
