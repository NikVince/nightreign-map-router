# Route Optimization Algorithm Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the route optimization algorithm for Elden Ring: Nightreign. The algorithm will calculate optimal paths between POIs based on priority scores, team composition, and various game state counters.

## Core Algorithm Architecture

### State Management Counters
The algorithm maintains several critical counters that influence route decisions:

#### 1. **Runes Gained Counter**
- **Purpose**: Tracks total runes collected during the expedition
- **Increment**: Add estimated rune rewards from each visited POI
- **Source**: POI_INFO_FOR_ALGORITHM.md rune values
- **Usage**: Determines player level and influences POI priority

#### 2. **Player Level**
- **Purpose**: Tracks current player level for difficulty calculations
- **Increment**: Automatic based on runes gained counter
- **Thresholds**: [PLACEHOLDER - Add precise level thresholds based on rune requirements]
- **Usage**: Determines which POIs are viable targets

#### 3. **Stonesword Keys Counter**
- **Purpose**: Tracks available keys for Evergaol access
- **Increment**: +1 when visiting Forts or Great Churches
- **Decrement**: -1 when visiting Evergaols
- **Usage**: Determines Evergaol accessibility

#### 4. **Countdown Timer**
- **Purpose**: Tracks remaining time in the day cycle
- **Start Value**: 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- **Decrement**: Subtract estimated completion time for each visited POI
- **Usage**: Determines route viability and circle constraints
