# Shifting Earth Events - Elden Ring Nightreign

## Overview
Shifting Earth in Nightreign are expedition modifiers that affect the geography of Limveld, boss and enemy spawns, challenges, and a secret that poses an opportunity to gain unique rewards. The shift is caused by defeating Nightlords or the boss that appears at the end of a run on the third day.

## Mechanics

### **Activation System**
- **Trigger**: Shifting Earth modifiers occur after defeating Nightlords or completing expeditions
- **Persistence**: Shifting Earth modifiers will persist for some time, and the conditions will be restored to normal after conducting several expeditions or passing some time at the Roundtable Hold
- **Manual Reset**: You may also use the bed to pass the time
- **Multiplayer**: If other players match with you but do not have a Shifting Earth event active, the map will generate with yours active. If multiple players join with a Shifting Earth event active, the game seems to randomly select one to generate

### **Pattern Integration**
- **Map Patterns**: Each Nightlord has 40 map patterns: 20 without any Shifting Earth, plus 5 per Shifting Earth event
- **Location Variation**: The location and specific implementation of Shifting Earth events can vary by pattern
- **Remembrance Quests**: Some Remembrance objectives are tied to specific Shifting Earth events

### **Achievement System**
- **Individual Achievements**: You will unlock a related achievement for discovering each of the secrets of the Shifting Earth
- **Completion Achievement**: There's also a golden trophy achievement upon discovering all Shifting Earth secrets

## The Four Shifting Earth Events

### 1. **The Crater (Volcanic)**
- **Location**: Northern section of map
- **Theme**: Volcanic/Magma environment
- **Unlock**: The first Shifting Earth event you'll unlock after defeating the first Night Lord, Tricephelos

#### **Environmental Changes**

- **Underground**: This area will open up to an underground temple, with a boss guarding the secret of The Crater

#### **Enemies and Bosses**
- **Fire Elemental Enemies**: All enemies here are fueled by fire resistance and attacks

### 2. **Mountaintop**

#### **Enemies and Bosses**
- **Frost Giants**: Large frozen humanoids
- **Ice Dragons**: Multiple dragon encounters

- **Dragon Damage Bonus**: Bonus to attack when you are near a Frostbite effect triggering
- **Location**: At the peak of the mountain after navigating the complete path

#### **Strategic Notes**
- **Navigation**: Start at the base, follow the main path while zig-zagging across chains
- **Preparation**: Fire damage highly recommended
- **Difficulty**: Moderate to high due to environmental hazards and multiple boss encounters

### 3. **Rotted Woods**
- **Location**: Variable position on map
- **Theme**: Scarlet Rot forest environment
- **Inspiration**: Swamp of Aeonia from Elden Ring

#### **Environmental Changes**
- **Landscape**: The southeastern region of Limveld will be transformed into a land ravaged by the Scarlet Rot
- **Hazard**: Passive Scarlet Rot buildup over time spent in this region
- **Mechanics**: This element is a common attack from enemies in the area, and you'll also passively build up on it as you explore

#### **Enemies and Bosses**
- **Rot-based Enemies**: Creatures that inflict and are immune to Scarlet Rot
- **Red Field Bosses**: The abundance of red field bosses, as long as you are lvl 9-11 you can do all of them easily with the Forest buff
- **Black Blade Kindred**: Possible boss encounter
- **Lordsworn Captain**: Possible boss encounter

#### **Unique Reward**
- **Favor of the Forest**: Nullifies scarlet rot and increases max HP
- **Rally Mechanic**: Attacks after receiving damage partially recover HP (similar to Bloodborne)

- **Countermeasures**: There are luminescent red flowers around trees that can remove the scarlet rot debuff

#### **Strategic Notes**
- **Preparation**: Scarlet Rot resistance/cures essential
- **Reward Quality**: The buff gives you more hp which is the best stat in the game
- **Rune Farming**: Excellent for rune farming due to abundant red field bosses
- **Map Feature**: A fort found further southwest holds the map to various secrets in the area

### 4. **Noklateo, the Shrouded City**
- **Location**: Northeast entrance (single entrance in middle of northeast wall)
- **Theme**: Eternal City environment
- **Inspiration**: Nokstella and Nokron from Elden Ring

#### **Environmental Changes**
- **Landscape**: The southwestern region of Limveld will transform into a huge structure covering this area with massive walls
- **Layout**: A maze of Eternal City-like buildings with complex navigation
- **Navigation**: You'll have to go underground, follow side paths, and take hidden Spiritspring jumps to reach the end

#### **Enemies and Bosses**
- **Eternal City Enemies**: Enemies and bosses taken straight out of Nokstella and Nokron
- **Astel**: The mysterious insectoid boss from Elden Ring appears in this event
- **Complex Encounters**: Multiple boss encounters within the city structure

#### **Unique Reward**
- **Revival Passive**: A passive bonus hidden deep in the temple within Noklateo that will revive you once from defeat and empower you temporarily upon self-reviving
- **Location**: Deep within the temple after navigating the complete maze
- **Power**: One of the most powerful bonuses in the game

#### **Strategic Notes**
- **Complexity**: Most complex navigation of all Shifting Earth events
- **Reward Value**: Extremely high - revival mechanic is game-changing
- **Preparation**: Requires significant exploration and patience
- **Remembrance Integration**: For example, Wylder must recover a Silver Tear from Noklateo for his Chapter 8 quest

## Management and Control

### **Clearing Shifting Earth Events**
To clear Shifting Earth effects, Nightreign players have two options:
1. **Natural Expiration**: Participate in Expeditions until the event disappears
2. **Manual Reset**: Interact with the bed in Roundtable Hold to pass time until the Shifting Earth event has ended

### **Accessing Specific Events**
- **Matchmaking**: If you don't have a specific event but want to experience it, join a party with someone who has it active
- **Invitation System**: Have friends invite you through Nightreign's invitation feature at the Roundtable
- **Event Persistence**: If an event occurs and it's not the one you want, you can get rid of it by sleeping in the bedrooms to pass the time

### **Everdark Sovereign Integration**
- **Custom Summoning**: To create Shifting Earth events, Nightreign players will have to get a new currency that can only be earned from high-level variants of the existing Nightlords
- **Collector's Board**: Follow this guide to learn the steps you need to follow to unlock the Collector's Board vendor, which offers the ability to summon a specific Shifting Earth in Nightreign using this new currency
- **Duration**: The next three to four times that you go on expeditions in Nightreign, your selected Shifting Earth event will be active

## Strategic Considerations

### **Timing Recommendations**
- **Day 1**: Generally avoid Shifting Earth areas unless well-prepared
- **Day 2**: Ideal time to tackle most Shifting Earth events
- **Planning**: Often, the best loot will be available in Nightreign's Shifting Earth locations

### **Risk vs. Reward**
- **High Risk**: Shifting Earth areas are typically the most dangerous
- **High Reward**: Often the best loot will be available in these locations
- **Positioning**: They're often a great place to make the best builds in Nightreign, as they have a high concentration of field bosses
- **Circle Safety**: The last place the night will close in

### **Team Coordination**
- **Communication**: Essential for navigating complex areas like Noklateo
- **Role Distribution**: Different events favor different character types
- **Preparation**: Team should prepare for specific environmental hazards

### **Expedition Planning**
- **Element Matching**: Choose events that complement your current build
- **Progression Goals**: Prioritize events based on needed upgrades
- **Achievement Hunting**: Target specific events for completion goals

## Event-Specific Remembrance Quests

### **Quest Integration**
- **Wylder**: Must recover a Silver Tear from Noklateo for his Chapter 8 quest
- **Forced Spawning**: If you have this Remembrance quest active, you will always see Noklateo spawn in Limveld
- **Quest Completion**: Some Remembrance objectives are tied to specific Shifting Earth events

### **Strategic Implications**
- **Guaranteed Access**: Active remembrance quests can force specific events
