# Complete Boss List - Elden Ring Nightreign

## Overview
In total, there are about a hundred bosses in Nightreign, eight of which serve as the Nightlord of the game's eight expeditions. Boss encounters in Limveld are randomized at the start of each Expedition. Minor bosses roam the region during the day, while a powerful boss appears at the end of each night.

## Nightlords (8 Primary Bosses)

### 1. **Gladius, Beast of Night**
- **Expedition**: Tricephalos
- **Difficulty**: Tutorial/Easiest
- **Description**: A three-headed doggo who splits into three one-headed doggos throughout the fight. Gladius also has a sword he loves to swing and some fiery breath attacks.
- **Phases**: Splits into 3 forms in Phase 2
- **Required**: Yes (first Nightlord, unlocks others)

### 2. **Maris, Fathom of Night**
- **Expedition**: Augur
- **Weakness**: Lightning
- **Description**: A watery creature similar in appearance to the Elden Beast that splashes players with Sleep-inducing attacks.
- **Special**: Dealing even a small amount of Lightning damage to Maris, Fathom of Night as it channels its global Sleep spell is enough to break its stance and cancel the attack.

### 3. **Gnoster, Churn of Night (Sentient Pest)**
- **Expedition**: Sentient Pest
- **Weakness**: Fire
- **Description**: The Sentient Pest is essentially a duo boss. This Nightlord is where things start to ramp up a bit in difficulty as you must split your attention between both the flying Moth boss and the gigantic Grub.
- **Special**: If you can get a source of Fire damage, you can melt both boss' HP bars as hitting either enemy with Fire creates a damage-over-time effect unique to this Nightlord.

### 4. **Libra, Equilibrious Beast**
- **Expedition**: Equilibrious Beast
- **Description**: A man-goat hybrid and eldritch monstrosity who can cripple players with Madness effects.
- **Special**: Can appear as invasion event in other expeditions

### 5. **Fulghor, Darkdrift Knight**
- **Expedition**: Darkdrift Knight
- **Weakness**: Lightning
- **Description**: The Darkdrift Knight is the hardest boss in Elden Ring Nightreign, and the most difficult Nightlord – it's even more difficult than the final boss.
- **Difficulty**: Hardest Nightlord
- **Abilities**: This is because it has a long-range charge attack that can be difficult to avoid, arena-covering AoE attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge, and because it's one of the most mobile Nightlords.

### 6. **Caligo, Waning Moon**
- **Expedition**: Fissure in the Fog
- **Description**: A massive ice dragon who breaths a chilling fog that inflicts heavy Frostbite damage.
- **Element**: Ice/Frost
- **Abilities**: Frost breath, Frostbite infliction

### 7. **Adel, Baron of Night**
- **Expedition**: Gaping Jaw
- **Weakness**: Fire
- **Description**: A dragon-like creature with gigantic jaws that stomps and charges around trying to snap up Nightfarers.
- **Special**: Gaping Jaw, for instance, stops leaping around the arena to throw up the poison, giving you a brief window to go all out.

### 8. **Heolstor, the Nightlord**
- **Expedition**: Night Aspect
- **Requirement**: After completing another three more, you'll get to fight Heolstor the Nightlord, Nightreign's true final boss.
- **Phases**: 2 phases (Shape of Night → Heolstor)
- **Weapons**: Heolstor the Nightlord is the Night Aspect's second phase, and it begins with him wielding what is effectively the Dark Moon Greatsword.

## Dark Souls Bosses (6 Confirmed)

There are six Dark Souls bosses in Elden Ring Nightreign from all three Souls games, including the Nameless King and the Gaping Dragon. In total, there are six bosses brought over from Dark Souls in Nightreign: two from the original Dark Souls, two from Dark Souls 2, and two from Dark Souls 3.

### Dark Souls 1 (2 Bosses)
#### **Centipede Demon**
- **Source**: Dark Souls 1
- **Expeditions**: To fight the Centipede Demon, Nightreign players must target either the Sentient Pest or Darkdrift Knight Expeditions, where the Centipede Demon will show up as either a Night 1 or Night 2 boss.
- **Mechanics**: In Elden Ring Nightreign, you won't need to worry about navigating a massive arena filled with lava, but you can still break off the Centipede Demon's parts to make it weaker. Watch out, though, as the severed parts will still try to attack players as separate enemies.

#### **Gaping Dragon**
- **Source**: Dark Souls 1
- **Expeditions**: To fight the Gaping Dragon, Nightreign players must target the Gaping Jaw Expedition, where the Gaping Dragon boss may show up as the main Night 2 boss.
- **Description**: The Gaping Dragon is an optional boss from Dark Souls that has become one of the most fondly remembered in the game. It's a spectacularly horrific boss – a dragon split in half with teeth lining its stomach is just hard to look at – and in Nightreign, the Gaping Dragon has been remastered in gruesome modern detail.

### Dark Souls 2 (2 Bosses)
#### **Smelter Demon**
- **Source**: Dark Souls 2
- **Description**: The second Dark Souls 2 boss to return is the Smelter Demon. It's based on the original Iron Keep model, but it appears to use some of the moves from the blue DLC variant.
- **Mechanics**: As with the original fight, if you get too close, you'll take gradual fire damage.

#### **Duke's Dear Freja**
- **Source**: Dark Souls 2
- **Description**: We found out that the Duke's Dear Freja was returning way back when Nightreign was first revealed, and they behave almost exactly the same as they did in Dark Souls 2. You can lop their heads off, they spawn little spiders, and occasionally they'll shoot a laser beam.
- **Mechanics**: What's different here is that they can be stunned.

### Dark Souls 3 (2 Bosses)
#### **Nameless King**
- **Source**: Dark Souls 3
- **Expeditions**: To fight the Nameless King, Nightreign players must target the Darkdrift Knight Expedition, which may feature the Nameless King as a main Night 2 boss.
- **Description**: Arguably the fan-favorite boss from the Dark Souls series, or at least the most iconic boss from Dark Souls 3, is the Nameless King. Said to be the spurned son of Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, the Nameless King rides upon the King of the Storm in what is one of the most difficult bosses in DS3.
- **Phases**: In Nightreign, the Nameless King has two phases, just like in his original fight. At first, you must fight him as he rides his dragon around the arena, hurling lightning bolts and ranged attacks as he soars between all-too-brief breaks on the ground.

#### **Dancer of the Boreal Valley**
- **Source**: Dark Souls 3
- **Expeditions**: To fight the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Nightreign players must target the Fissure in the Fog Expedition, where the Dancer boss may show up as the main boss of either Night 1 or Night 2.
- **Description**: The Dancer of the Boreal Valley from Dark Souls III makes an appearance in Nightreign as a Night Boss. This tall, armored knight wields a flame sword, then adds a magic sword once its HP is halved, making the fight even more challenging.

## Evergaol Bosses

Evergaol translates to eternal jail, and these locations appear in Limveld with various bosses inside them. To challenge the captive to a fight, you will need a Stonesword Key. There's no way to know which boss you will be facing until you use the Stonesword Key.

### Rune Values (Based on Difficulty)
The rune amounts are:
- 10k: Nox, Omen, Stoneskins, Beasly Brigade, Beastmen, Bloodhound Knight, Banished Knights, Duelist

### **The Oldest Gaol** (Highest Tier - 30k Runes)
The three bosses that need to spawn at an Evergaol are Deathrite Bird, Godskin Duo, or the Ancient Dragon. If you open an Evergaol and one of these bosses appears, then you have started the event for the trophy.

#### **Ancient Dragon**
- **Runes**: 30,000
- **Location**: This evergaol boss can be found most reliably in the Night Aspect expedition with The Mountaintop active. There's a 40% chance it will be in the evergaol on the eastern edge of the map.
- **Description**: Night 2 boss for Gaping Jaw and Night Aspect

#### **Death Rite Bird**
- **Runes**: 30,000
- **Location**: This evergaol boss can be found most reliably in the Sentient Pest expedition with The Rotted Woods active. There's a 20% chance it will be in the evergaol on the northern edge of the map and a 20% chance it will be in the evergaol in the northeast, by the tunnel entrance.
- **Description**: Night 2 boss for Equilibrious Beast, Night Aspect and (rarely) Gaping Jaw

Godskin Noble, and that White dragon with red lightning was also Evergaol bosses.

## Field Bosses

Field Bosses represent the locations of bosses found in unnamed areas in Limveld. These bosses are not revealed until you encounter them directly. Field Bosses are only revealed on day 2, or by interacting with the map found inside the tower in Forts.

### **Confirmed Field Bosses**
Field bosses, such as the Magma Wyrm, Battlemages, or the Oracle Envoys, can be found while exploring during the first two days.

- **Lordsworn Captain** (Found in Rotted Woods)

### **Runebear Duo**
Version 1.01: the Runebear duo boss is currently bugged on PC. Only one bear has the boss HP bar but both bears drop boss loot.

## Night Bosses (End of Day 1 & 2)

Night Bosses appear at the end of each day, and their appearance depends on the day count. As the Ring of Blue Flames forms, your exploration will gradually be limited. Once the appropriate size of the Ring is reached, the Night Boss will be summoned. These bosses are non-optional and must be defeated to progress onto the next day.

## Event Bosses

### **Fell Omen (Margit)**
- **Type**: Random invasion boss
- **Description**: The Fell Omen stalks the Nightfarers in their journey throughout Limveld, and can also invade at random.
- **Mechanics**: This boss will target one player exclusively (indicated by a red and white dot on the target player) and will never change targets unless that player is downed.
- **Rewards**: 30,000 Runes and Traces of Grace-Given Lord, which raises your attack power after interacting with newly found Sites of Grace
- **Penalty**: Losing to the Fell Omen will inflict a wound called Unhealed Wound Carved by the Night, which increases damage taken for the rest of the expedition.

### **Tutorial Boss**
- **Name**: Fell Omen (Margit)
- **Reward**: The relic is called Fell Omen Fetish, and it grants the following buffs. Boosts attack power while switching weapons. Increases throwing knife damage.
- **Replayable**: For players who're looking to replay the tutorial for Elden Ring Nightreign, they'll need to access the Visual Codex inside Roundtable Hold.

### **Everdark Sovereign Bosses**
The Everdark Sovereigns in active weekly rotation are Gaping Jaw, Darkdrift Knight, and Sentient Pest. Four additional Everdark Sovereign Expeditions are scheduled to appear in future updates.

The Nightlord bosses of Everdark Sovereign missions are significantly more difficult, featuring upgraded strength and new movesets. They start at Phase 2 and advance to an empowered Phase 3.

## Remembrance Bosses

Remembrance Bosses are exclusive bosses that are only encountered when players relive a Nightfarer's Remembrance Quest. These bosses require players to progress a Nightfarer's quest to fight them, and they can both be fought in the Roundtable Hold or Limveld.

### **Class-Specific Bosses**
These class-specific bosses are only fought under special circumstances, most often to complete Nightreign Remembrances or unlock the Nightreign Revenant.

*Note: Specific remembrance bosses require further documentation as they are tied to individual character quest lines.*

## Boss Scaling and Mechanics

### **Day Progression**
Bosses are promoted or simply get stronger on day two. Bosses do not regenerate health over time or between days.

### **Rewards**
Defeating a boss creates a Site of Grace and a blue, purple, or gold Dormant Power. Interacting with the object opens a menu with two to three reward choices.

### **Multiplayer Scaling**
Unlike in other FromSoftware games, when you die fighting a boss, the progress will not be reset right away. You can have one of your teammates revive you to continue the boss fight.

## Notes on Boss Design

Eight all-new Nightlord bosses were crafted for Nightreign. Many bosses first appeared in Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Dark Souls III, and Elden Ring. Some returning Elden Ring bosses were renamed to be more generic. Many use "new" moves that were originally cut content.

In an interview, game director Junya Ishizaki said that the inclusion of Dark Souls bosses in Nightreign is purely a design choice to add enemy variety and not a sign of shared lore or continuity.
