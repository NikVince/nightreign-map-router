# Landmarks and Map System - Elden Ring Nightreign

## Map System Overview

### Pattern System
- **Total Map Patterns**: 320 unique patterns (8 Nightlords × 40 patterns each)
- **Pattern Composition**: Each Nightlord has 40 map patterns: 20 without any Shifting Earth, plus 5 per Shifting Earth event
- **Seed System**: A 32-bit random expedition seed determines the map pattern (including shifting earth) and the active remembrance when multiple options are available. It is generated only after matchmaking and selecting a target Nightlord.
- **Circle Mechanics**: While second circle locations are set by the pattern, the first circle location is random based on the expedition seed.

### Map Characteristics
- **Static Elements**: The overall shape of the map, including the topography, and any environmental points of interest like Sites of Grace, Spectral Hawk Trees, and Spiritstreams remain static.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Most other elements, however, will be randomized across the map. This includes forts, cathedrals, churches, camps, and ruins.
- **Procedural Generation**: The layout of Limveld will change each time you visit. With every expedition, bases, types of enemies, chest rewards, and other features of the field will fluctuate.

## Primary Landmarks (11 Types)

There are 11 primary Landmarks in Nightreign, and all of them are guaranteed to appear in every Expedition. However, the number and location of them is not set. Certain Landmarks, like Castles, will always be in the very middle of the map and there will only ever be one.

### 1. **Churches**
- **Icon**: Small church symbol
- **Function**: Houses of worship visited by pilgrims. Sacred Flask uses can be increased in these locations.
- **Contents**: +1 Sacred Flask use
- **Priority**: High (should be visited on Day 1 and 2)
- **Strategy**: Setting a marker towards the churches on the map is incredibly important because they reward you with flask upgrades that drastically increase your survivability. By the time you reach the Night Lord on day 3, you should have around 7 flasks.
- **Frequency**: Every Expedition has at least three Churches that players can find
- **Safety**: Usually empty except for the Altars, making it a sought-after spot for Nightfarers
