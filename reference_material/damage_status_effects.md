# Damage Types and Status Effects - Elden Ring Nightreign

## Overview
Damage Types in Nightreign play a crucial role in Combat. While specific details are still scarce, it's likely they follow a similar structure to the previous game, where damage was categorized into two major groups: Physical and Elemental. Damage types are influenced by various factors such as equipment, skills, and temporary buffs.

## Damage Type System

### **Physical Damage Types (4 Categories)**

#### 1. **Standard (Physical)**
- **Description**: Physical Damage that is effective against most enemies throughout Limveld
- **Sources**: Most basic weapon attacks
- **Effectiveness**: Universally applicable
- **Scaling**: Typically scales with Strength or Dexterity

#### 2. **Strike**
- **Description**: A type of damage that is dealt through blunt weapons such as Hammers or Maces
- **Sources**: Hammers, maces, clubs, fists
- **Effectiveness**: Good against armored enemies
- **Scaling**: Primarily Strength-based

#### 3. **Slash**
- **Description**: A type of damage that is dealt through sharp weapons such as Katanas or Daggers
- **Sources**: Swords, katanas, daggers, scythes
- **Effectiveness**: Good against unarmored enemies
- **Scaling**: Dexterity or Strength depending on weapon

#### 4. **Pierce**
- **Description**: A type of damage that is dealt through thrusting-type weapons such as Spears, or Lances
- **Sources**: Spears, lances, rapiers, arrows
- **Effectiveness**: Good against specific enemy types
- **Scaling**: Primarily Dexterity-based

### **Elemental Damage Types (4 Categories)**

#### 1. **Fire**
- **Description**: A type of Elemental Damage that is dealt through casting Sorceries or Incantations that cast out Fire onto enemies
- **Sources**: Fire spells, fire-infused weapons, incantations
- **Scaling**: Fire damage generally scales with Strength, though the specific scaling can vary based on the weapon and its infusion
- **Effectiveness**: Strong against ice enemies, certain bosses (Gnoster, Adel)

#### 2. **Lightning**
- **Description**: A type of Elemental Damage that is dealt through casting Magic Spells that cast out Lightning, shocking enemies
- **Sources**: Lightning spells, lightning-infused weapons, incantations
- **Effectiveness**: Particularly effective against Maris and Fulghor
- **Special**: Essential for breaking Nightlord stances

#### 3. **Magic**
- **Description**: A type of Elemental Damage that is dealt through casting Magic Spells that are not associated with Fire, Lightning, or Holy spells
- **Sources**: Most sorceries, glintstone staff attacks
- **Scaling**: Scales with Intelligence
- **Effectiveness**: Magic only has 1x or lower multipliers, so it can be said to be the worst or most consistent

#### 4. **Holy**
- **Description**: A type of Elemental Damage that is dealt through offensive Incantations
- **Sources**: Holy spells, blessed weapons, incantations
- **Scaling**: Scales with Faith
- **Effectiveness**: Effective against certain enemies and Gladius

## Status Effects System

### **Status Buildup Mechanics**
As you damage enemies with a status-inflicting weapon, you build up a bar. When the bar fills, the effect activates. Some statuses, like Poison and Scarlet Rot, deal damage over time when the duration continues until the bar empties completely. Others, like Blood Loss and Frostbite, deliver a burst of damage that scales with the target's maximum health.

### **Major Status Effects**

#### **Blood Loss**
- **Type**: Burst damage
- **Buildup**: Higher damage with higher max HP
- **Description**: Techniques designed to wound and exsanguinate can inflict acute Blood Loss
- **Effectiveness**: Blood Loss and Frostbite are both particularly effective ailments as they deal a percentage of the boss's health
- **Scaling**: Scales with target's maximum health
- **Coverage**: Good general purpose - bleed and poison being tied but bleed being better overall

#### **Frostbite**
- **Type**: Burst damage + vulnerability
- **Buildup**: Higher damage with higher max HP
- **Description**: Cold and Freezing techniques can inflict Frostbite
- **Special Effect**: Frostbite further leaves the enemy vulnerable to damage for a short time after
- **Effectiveness**: Frost is a good general purpose tool. Most bosses and enemies (although not all) are vulnerable to it, it's not dependent on stat scaling, and it increases the damage a target takes while they are under its effects
- **Coverage**: Frost is the next most "least immune/resistant" after Rot

#### **Poison**
- **Type**: Damage over time
- **Buildup**: Continuous damage
- **Description**: Continuous damage Toxins designed to whittle and slowly sap the life from enemies can inflict Poison or Deadly Poison
- **Effectiveness**: I honestly really like a poison setup especially for day 1 and 2, it really speeds up the early game
- **Coverage**: Bleed and poison being tied but bleed being better overall

#### **Scarlet Rot**
- **Type**: Damage over time (stronger than poison)
- **Buildup**: Continuous damage
- **Description**: Continuous damage Pathogens designed to crumble the very being of its enemies and consume their flesh can inflict Scarlet Rot
- **Effectiveness**: Rot has the most coverage as none are immune
- **Coverage**: Best overall coverage against all enemies

#### **Sleep**
- **Type**: Debuff
- **Buildup**: Lose FP and enter a state of high vulnerability
- **Description**: Tranquilizing agents that don't inflict damage but instead cause a negative effect, such as making the target more vulnerable
- **Effect**: Makes enemies temporarily helpless
- **Source**: Maris uses Sleep-inducing attacks

#### **Madness**
- **Type**: Debuff
- **Description**: Causes loss of control and vulnerability
- **Effect**: Can cripple players with loss of control
- **Source**: Libra can inflict Madness effects

#### **Death Blight**
- **Type**: Instant kill
- **Description**: A status that inflicts Death, downing your character when the bar fills
- **Effect**: Instantly downs the character when bar fills
- **Severity**: Most dangerous status effect

## Weapon Affinity System

### **Affinity Mechanics**
Affinity represents the damage type that your weapon does through Physical and Elemental damage. The two damage types are further classified into four sub types with each weapon varying in their damage type. A weapon with more than one affinity can afflict enemies with each affinity that it has.

### **Combination Example**
For example, the Rivers of Blood Katana does Slash/Pierce while dealing fire damage and blood loss build up for each attack it does.

### **Innate Affinities**
Some weapons like the Winged Scythe have innate holy affinity.

## Elemental Weakness System

### **Spell Affinities**
A spell's natural affinity will often lean towards the 4 Elemental Damage types: Fire, Lightning, Holy, and Magic. Identifying a spell's affinity can be as easy as looking at the spell's name or icon.

### **Resistance Mechanics**
Resistance determines whether a specific enemy is weak to a damage type or not. This also applies to status effects or ailments as having more resistance can slow down its buildup.

### **Enemy Weaknesses (General)**
These are general weaknesses. Enemies may be weak or resistant to a different damage type than shown above.

- **Fire**: Generally effective against ice enemies, plant enemies
- **Lightning**: Effective against water enemies, metal armor
- **Holy**: Effective against undead, dark creatures
- **Magic**: Consistent damage, rarely resisted

## Nightlord Weaknesses

### **Confirmed Weaknesses**
- **Gladius**: Blood Loss, Holy damage
- **Maris**: Lightning (breaks stance during Sleep spell)
- **Gnoster**: Fire (creates damage-over-time effect)
- **Adel**: Fire
- **Fulghor**: Lightning
- **Caligo**: Fire (effective against ice)
- **Libra**: Not specified
- **Heolstor**: Not specified

### **Weakness Coverage Analysis**
- **Fire**: Effective against 4 bosses (Gnoster, Adel, Caligo, general effectiveness)
- **Lightning**: Effective against 2 bosses (Maris, Fulghor)
- **Holy**: Effective against 1 boss (Gladius)
- **Blood Loss**: Effective against 1 boss (Gladius)

## Status Effect Coverage

### **Best General Purpose Status Effects**
1. **Scarlet Rot**: Most coverage as none are immune
2. **Frostbite**: Next most "least immune/resistant"
3. **Blood Loss/Poison**: Tied effectiveness, bleed generally better
4. **Magic**: Most consistent but lower multipliers

### **Nightlord Immunities**
- **Frostbite**: Caligo, Maris, and Heolstor are immune
- **Blood Loss/Poison/Frost**: Heolstor (final boss) is immune to all of these
- **Magic**: Only has 1x or lower multipliers

## Weapon Buff System

### **Weapon Buffs**
All Weapon Buffs are self-targeted and grant a bonus to an equipped Armament, such as extra Fire Damage or Scarlet Rot buildup on attacks.

### **Buff Examples**
- **Determination**: Increases attack power
- **Poison Grease**: Adds poison buildup
- **Fire Grease**: Adds fire damage
- **Shield Grease**: Protective coating

### **Buff Mechanics**
- **Application**: Apply their effects to the weapon equipped in the right hand (or both hands)
- **Duration**: They expire early if the weapon is unequipped or dropped
- **Dual Wielding**: It's possible to keep two weapons buffed at the same time by two-handing the left-hand weapon and using either a Grease or a Skill on it

### **Buff Restrictions**
- **Weapon Types**: Cannot be applied to ranged weapons, torches, staves, or sacred seals
- **Weapon Compatibility**: Some weapons cannot be buffed unless their innate skill grants them a weapon buff

## Relic System Integration

### **Elemental Relic Effects**
- **"Starting armament deals [element] damage"**: Changes weapon's damage type
- **"Starting armament inflicts [status effect]"**: Adds status buildup
- **Combination Rule**: You cannot combine magic damage with innate frostbite, but you can have inflicts bleed and the chilling mist Ash of War on your starting weapon

### **Available Elements in Relics**
- **All elements are available**: Fire, Lightning, Holy, Magic
- **Status Effects**: Poison, Frost, Bleed confirmed
- **Possibly Removed**: Rot, Sleep, Madness may have been cut from relics

## Strategic Considerations

### **Damage Type Selection**
- **Universal**: Fire and Holy are pretty universally good
- **Specific**: Lightning is great on most of the harder bosses
- **Consistent**: Magic for steady, predictable damage

### **Status Effect Priority**
- **Early Game**: Poison for speeding up encounters
- **General Use**: Frostbite for broad effectiveness
- **Boss Fights**: Match specific weaknesses when possible

### **Team Coordination**
- **Elemental Diversity**: Team should cover multiple damage types
- **Status Synergy**: Combine effects for maximum efficiency
- **Weakness Exploitation**: Plan loadouts around target Nightlord
