**Faith Classes** (Revenant, Recluse hybrid) focus on **Sacred Seals** and incantation-scaling weapons, with **Revenant** benefiting from summoning enhancement items.

### Route Planning Considerations

**Day 1 Priorities** include immediate leveling to 2, Sacred Flask upgrades at Churches, easy boss encounters at Forts/Great Churches, and Smithing Stone acquisition at Tunnels. Target level 6-7 by day's end.

**Day 2 Priorities** focus on Boss Weakness POIs for Nightlord preparation, remaining Church visits, Castle farming at levels 8-9, and Field Boss encounters. Target level 11-12 by day's end.

**Class-Specific Route Optimization:**
- **Ranged Classes** (Ironeye, Recluse) can engage Field Bosses earlier and should prioritize bow/staff spawn locations
- **Melee Classes** (Guardian, Raider, Executor) require weapon upgrades before tackling harder content and should prioritize Smithing Stone locations
- **Hybrid Classes** (Duchess, Wylder, Revenant) offer routing flexibility and can adapt to team composition needs

## Conclusion

Understanding each class's stat scaling enables precise equipment prioritization and route optimization for maximum efficiency in the three-day expedition cycle. **Level 12** represents the practical progression cap, making early game weapon upgrades and relic acquisition crucial for success against the challenging Nightlord encounters.
