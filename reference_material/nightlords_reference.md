# Nightlords Reference - Elden Ring Nightreign

## Overview
The Nightlords are a group of primary bosses in Elden Ring Nightreign. There are eight Nightlord bosses in the base game. An Expedition to hunt the boss is intiated at the Great Site of Grace at the Roundtable Hold. The Nightlords' realm is accessed through a petrified tree in a purple area of the Spirit Shelter at Noontide on the final day.

## Nightlord Mechanics

### **Core Mechanics**
- **Scripted Weaknesses**: Each Nightlord has a scripted weakness to a particular source of damage
- **Stance Breaking**: Exploiting weaknesses can break stance and cancel attacks
- **Selection Process**: Unlike other encounters, the final boss is not randomized; instead, they are selected between rounds by interacting with the Table of Lost Grace at the Roundtable Hold
- **Progression**: Eight all-new Nightlord bosses were crafted for Nightreign

### **Unlock Sequence**
1. **Gladius** (Tricephalos) - Must be defeated first
2. **Six Nightlords** unlock after defeating Gladius
3. **Heolstor** unlocks after defeating any 3 of the 6 additional Nightlords

### **Everdark Sovereigns**
- **Enhanced Versions**: Everdark Sovereigns are challenging versions of the standard Expeditions, available for a limited-time on a weekly rotation
- **Requirements**: Players can only challenge an Everdark Sovereign after defeating its standard Nightlord form
- **Difficulty**: The Nightlord bosses of Everdark Sovereign missions are significantly more difficult, featuring upgraded strength and new movesets. They start at Phase 2 and advance to an empowered Phase 3.
- **Current Rotation**: The Everdark Sovereigns in active weekly rotation are Gaping Jaw, Darkdrift Knight, and Sentient Pest. Four additional Everdark Sovereign Expeditions are scheduled to appear in future updates.

## Individual Nightlords

### 1. **Gladius, Beast of Night**
- **Expedition**: Tricephalos
- **Unlock**: Starting Nightlord (required)
- **Difficulty**: Tutorial/Easiest
- **Weakness**: Blood Loss, Holy damage
- **Description**: A three-headed doggo who splits into three one-headed doggos throughout the fight. Gladius also has a sword he loves to swing and some fiery breath attacks.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Phase 1**: Fights as single three-headed entity
- **Phase 2**: Splits into 3 separate wolves - encourages each team member to take one
- **Key Attack**: Chained Sword Slam - pay attention to the chain, dodge when it swings above head and slows down
- **Strategy**: As one beast, your Guardian or Raider should be able to keep it occupied, but its multiple forms are exponentially harder to handle

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Melee**: Weapons with Blood Loss buildup
- **Magic**: Holy damage spells
- **Team Comp**: Guardian/Raider for tanking, distributed damage for split phase

### 2. **Maris, Fathom of Night**
- **Expedition**: Augur
- **Unlock**: After Gladius
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Weakness**: Lightning
- **Description**: A watery creature similar in appearance to the Elden Beast that splashes players with Sleep-inducing attacks.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Range**: Squid-like entity that drifts across the battlefield, often far beyond the reach of melee attacks
- **Sleep Spell**: Global Sleep spell that can be interrupted
- **Stance Break**: Dealing even a small amount of Lightning damage to Maris, Fathom of Night as it channels its global Sleep spell is enough to break its stance and cancel the attack
- **Strategy**: Guardians and Raiders won't be of much use here; instead, this fight is where the Ironeye truly shines

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Optimal**: Ironeye with lightning-damage bows
- **Ranged Focus**: Bows, crossbows, magic users
- **Team Comp**: At least one Ironeye, minimal melee

### 3. **Gnoster, Churn of Night (Sentient Pest)**
- **Expedition**: Sentient Pest
- **Unlock**: After Gladius
- **Difficulty**: Medium-Hard
- **Weakness**: Fire
- **Description**: The Sentient Pest is essentially a duo boss. This Nightlord is where things start to ramp up a bit in difficulty as you must split your attention between both the flying Moth boss and the gigantic Grub.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Dual Entity**: Flying Moth + Giant Grub
- **Phase 1**: Split team - some focus moth, others focus grub
- **Phase 2**: Both creatures merge into one, charge forward with magic attacks
- **Fire Weakness**: If you can get a source of Fire damage, you can melt both boss' HP bars as hitting either enemy with Fire creates a damage-over-time effect unique to this Nightlord
- **Strategy**: The team should split up to handle both targets effectively

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Essential**: Fire damage weapons/spells
- **Ironeye Role**: Focus on moth from distance
- **Melee Role**: Target the grub, watch stomp patterns
- **Team Comp**: Balanced with fire damage capability

### 4. **Libra, Equilibrious Beast**
- **Expedition**: Equilibrious Beast
- **Unlock**: After Gladius
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Weakness**: Not specified
- **Description**: A man-goat hybrid and eldritch monstrosity who can cripple players with Madness effects.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Madness Effects**: Can inflict Madness status on players
- **Invasion Capability**: Can appear as invasion event in other expeditions
- **Health Curse**: On rare occasions, this monster places a curse on you that caps your maximum HP (can be removed for 10,000 Runes)

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Madness Resistance**: Items that reduce Madness buildup
- **Ranged Options**: Safer to maintain distance
- **Team Comp**: Balanced with focus on status resistance

### 5. **Fulghor, Darkdrift Knight**
- **Expedition**: Darkdrift Knight
- **Unlock**: After Gladius
- **Difficulty**: Hardest Nightlord
- **Weakness**: Lightning
- **Description**: The Darkdrift Knight is the hardest boss in Elden Ring Nightreign, and the most difficult Nightlord – it's even more difficult than the final boss.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Mobility**: One of the most mobile Nightlords
- **Long-range Attacks**: Long-range charge attack that can be difficult to avoid
- **AoE Coverage**: Arena-covering AoE attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge
- **Speed**: Fulghor swiftly sprints around the arena and closes distance quickly with fast stabs and aerial slam attacks
- **Attack Pattern**: Pay special attention to when the boss stops to begin its AoE attack, which will spawn blades around the arena that slam down for massive damage

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Essential**: Lightning damage weapons
- **Strategy**: If you are able to acquire a weapon with the Lightning affinity, use it in this fight to more easily interrupt Fulghor
- **Team Comp**: High mobility characters, ranged support

### 6. **Caligo, Waning Moon**
- **Expedition**: Fissure in the Fog
- **Unlock**: After Gladius
- **Difficulty**: Medium-Hard
- **Weakness**: Not specified
- **Description**: A massive ice dragon who breaths a chilling fog that inflicts heavy Frostbite damage.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Element**: Ice/Frost-based attacks
- **Frostbite**: Inflicts heavy Frostbite damage
- **Breath Attacks**: Chilling fog breath weapon
- **Special Attack**: Has a special attack where you need to follow the winds to head towards the dragon and hide behind the ice blocks around it
- **Strategy**: Bows are particularly helpful, as always in Nightreign

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Fire Damage**: Effective against ice-based enemy
- **Ranged Weapons**: Bows, crossbows for safety
- **Cold Resistance**: Items that reduce Frostbite buildup
- **Team Comp**: Ironeye for ranged damage, fire-based casters

### 7. **Adel, Baron of Night**
- **Expedition**: Gaping Jaw
- **Unlock**: After Gladius
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Weakness**: Fire
- **Description**: A dragon-like creature with gigantic jaws that stomps and charges around trying to snap up Nightfarers.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **Phase 1**: Not too aggressive, but dangerous
- **Phase 2**: Activates when below 50% health
- **Crushing Maw**: Most dangerous move - opens mouth wide and charges. Dodge left/right, never backward/forward
- **Power-up**: If Adel eats you, he powers up his next set of attacks
- **Toxin Pools**: Throws poison pools
- **Stance Break**: Gaping Jaw, for instance, stops leaping around the arena to throw up the poison, giving you a brief window to go all out

#### **Equipment Recommendations**
- **Essential**: Fire damage (weakness)
- **Secondary**: Poison resistance
- **Strategy**: Mix of Poison and Frost ailments recommended
- **Team Comp**: Melee with fire weapons, ranged support

## Constellation Theory

The nightlords seem to take a lot of inspiration from constellations, which makes sense considering their ties to the night. This thematic connection suggests deeper lore implications for their design and abilities.
